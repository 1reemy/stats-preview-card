## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to use CSS Flex to position and style the Stat Preview Card based on the example provided by Frontend Mentor. Some CSS Flex techniques I used are:
 - flex-direction: 'row'
 - align-items: 'center'
 - justify-content: 'flex-start'
I also learnt how to position images and fix it such that it looked according to the example. I however am yet to learn how to tint the image with the violet colour.

### Continued development

I hope to learn how to use the CSS Grid to position HTML objects in the future and gain an appreciation of the CSS positioning types. I also intend to use Bootstrap.

### Useful resources
